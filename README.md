# Elite101-PreWork
This repository contains my pre-work project for the Elite 101 course at Code2College.
The pre-work is a python chatbot. I chose the scenario:  create a simple chatbot for a retail store that can answer customers' frequently asked questions about store hours, location, available products, and prices.
